This study explores water level fluctuations in the Bani River, particularly focusing on its outlet in Mopti. Bani River is the principal tributary of the Niger River, supporting agricultural activities in Mali, CÃ´te d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso Monitoring and managing this major river in Africa have been challenging given the socio-political instability in the region which disrupts data collection. To address this issue, this research evaluates the effectiveness of satellite rainfall estimates for monitoring the Bani catchment and develops machine learning models tailored for predicting these water fluctuations. Two primary satellite data products (CHIRPS and PERSIANN-CDR) are compared to identify the satellite rainfall estimates that provide the most accurate spatial information over the basin. The study uses machine learning techniques to enhance the predictive accuracy of water level forecasts, addressing both climatic and local human-made impacts. The findings of this study contribute towards improving resilience against environmental variability and socio-political challenges.
